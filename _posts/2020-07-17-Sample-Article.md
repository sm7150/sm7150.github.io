# A. BEGINNER!
Since my brain is wanting to make some website without spending any currency, I was able to found a free template website github source that is currently supported by github pages [HERE FOR THE SOURCE OF THE TEMPLATE](https://github.com/kitian616/jekyll-TeXt-theme). I think making website nor pages is very hard until I found this github pages utility and the template. Currently this is my first testing site/pages I made.

# B. MOVING UP!
## Experience
My experience about computer codes is really low and not good, but I tried to study them all till I understand their function and their movement.
